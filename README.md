This project focuses on predictive maintenance for turbofan engines using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the C-MAPSS dataset from NASA, the project aims to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines, enabling timely maintenance to prevent failures. Key components include robust data preprocessing, creation of meaningful features, and categorization of operational settings. This project Random Forest Regression for RUL prediction and applies Conjoint Analysis to understand the impact of operational settings on engine performance.
